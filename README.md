Python Basics

I have been actively reading the book 
"Learn Python the Hard Way" 3rd Edition by Zed Shaw
 - A very simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code

I have been completing the exercises as I go along. I am currently on Exercise 44a.

I have uploaded them here for you to look at as well. 

In order for you to be able to run these exercises from the book you must use PowerShell to enter the Python commands.

You can use a simple IDE such as NOTEPAD++ in order to write your code.

The book makes you use Python 2 or (version 2.7) to be exact.
