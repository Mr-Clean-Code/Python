Python Basics

I have been actively reading the book 
"Learn Python the Hard Way" 3rd Edition by Zed Shaw
 - A very simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code

I have been completing the exercises as I go along. I am currently on Exercise 44a.

I have uploaded them here for you to look at as well.
